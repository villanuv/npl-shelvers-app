# Shelvers Web Application

This is an independent initiative to streamline process at the Northbrook Public Library's Circulation Department. Part of it is to reduce paper waste, since we are currently utilizing both letter and legal-sized paper to facilitate Shelver activity on a daily basis. But the main problem it solves has to do translating all antiquated practices with automated actions or converting documentation to an interactive interface. Assigning tasks, calculating time and printing has taken up to 14 hours a month; approximately 2 hours/week from Danny, our Assistant Manager. Another coworker, Diane, is helping maintain the spreadsheet of data, which has been manually calculated in the past. I am unsure how much effort she puts into it, but know that it's her side project here. And lastly, to make it easier for everyone involved.
